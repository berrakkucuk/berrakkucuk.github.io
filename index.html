		<h1> Hello! </h1>
		<p> I'm a 19 year old computer engineering student from Ankara University and currently, I'm in Krakow for Erasmus. I'll 
			continue my education in AGH University of Science and Technology for a semester. 
			<br> I'm planning to keep a track on what I've learned from my JavaScript and HTML/CSS lessons during that time, 
			while keeping a diary about my Erasmus memories here :) </p>
		<h3> What I have done so far? </h3>
		<p> I arrived Krakow 3 weeks ago and most of my lessons started last week. So far, I have travelled mostly in Krakow. I've 
			spend most of my time in <strong>Kraków Główny</strong> which means <em>The Main Market Square</em> and known as 
			<strong> Old Town </strong>, which is the biggest main square in Europe. It is really magnificent with all the old
			buildings, never-ending alleys and secret places that are always crowded no matter what day it is. </p>
